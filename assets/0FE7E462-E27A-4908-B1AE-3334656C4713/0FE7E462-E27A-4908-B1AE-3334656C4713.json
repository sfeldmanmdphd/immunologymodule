T cells stimulate the progeny of IgM– and IgD–expressing B lymphocytes to produce antibodies of different heavy-chain isotypes (classes). Different antibody isotypes perform different functions, and therefore the process of isotype switching broadens the functional capabilities of humoral immune responses. Heavy-chain isotype switching is induced by a combination of CD40 ligand (CD40L)-mediated signals and cytokines. These signals act on antigen-stimulated B cells and induce switching in some of the progeny of these cells. In the absence of CD40 or CD40L, B cells secrete only IgM and fail to switch to other isotypes, indicating the essential role of this ligand-receptor pair in isotype switching. Cytokines produced by follicular helper T cells determine which heavy-chain isotype is produced.","targetRectangle":{"y":67.12823867797852,"x":348.4845275878906,"width":668.09184,"height":185.6399999856949}},{"text":"The molecular mechanism of isotype switching, called class switch recombination (CSR), takes the previously formed VDJ exon encoding the V domain of an Ig µ heavy chain and moves it adjacent to a downstream C region. IgM-producing B cells, which have not undergone switching, contain in their Ig heavy-chain locus a rearranged VDJ gene adjacent to the first constant-region cluster, which is Cμ. The heavy-chain mRNA is produced by splicing a VDJ exon to Cμ exons in the initially transcribed RNA, and this mRNA is translated to produce a μ heavy chain, which combines with a light chain to give rise to an IgM antibody. Thus, the first antibody produced by B cells is IgM. Signals from CD40 and cytokine receptors stimulate transcription through one of the constant regions that is downstream of Cμ. In the intron 5′ of each constant region (except Cδ) is a conserved nucleotide sequence called the switch region. During switch recombination, the switch region 5′ of Cμ recombines with the switch region adjacent to the transcriptionally active downstream constant region, and the intervening DNA is deleted. An enzyme called activation-induced deaminase (AID), which is induced by CD40 signals, plays a key role in this process. AID converts cytosines in DNA to uracil (U). The sequential action of other enzymes results in the removal of the U’s and the creation of nicks in the DNA. Such a process on both strands leads to double-stranded DNA breaks. When double-stranded DNA breaks in two switch regions are brought together and repaired, the intervening DNA is removed, and the rearranged VDJ exon that was originally close to Cμ may now be brought immediately upstream of the constant region of a different isotype (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgE). The result is that the B cell begins to produce a new heavy-chain isotype (determined by the C region of the antibody) with the same specificity as that of the original B cell, because specificity is determined by the sequence of the VDJ exon, which is not altered. Note that although the C region changes, the VDJ region, and thus the specificity of the antibody, is preserved. (Each C region gene consists of multiple exons, but only one is shown for simplicity.)","targetRectangle":{"y":252.7682386636734,"x":348.4845275878906,"width":667.52032,"height":469.5284045219421}},{"text":"Index","targetRectangle":{"y":720.5000004768372,"x":466.9819989204407,"width":90.03600000000006,"height":43}},{"text":"Next Topic","targetRectangle":{"y":720.5000004768372,"x":810.9680001735687,"width":170.064,"height":43}},{"text":"How do B cells change the antibody isotype?","targetRectangle":{"y":7.866657257080078,"x":79.8994923706054,"width":864.201,"height":47}},{"text":"￼","targetRectangle":{"y":739.5,"x":994.6040006279945,"width":17.79200000000003,"height":19}},{"text":"pasted-image.png","targetRectangle":{"y":67.237060546875,"x":22.69662475585938,"width":309.9672241210938,"height":661.2023315429688}},{"text":"Video of this topic","targetRectangle":{"y":720.5000004768372,"x":10.26999568939209,"width":287.46,"height":43}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"440B9499CBC27A5249485E49F7BFDC0A"}]}]}}]}
