In this disorder, pre-B cells in the bone marrow fail to expand, resulting in a marked decrease or absence of mature B lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulins. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding a kinase called Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), resulting in defective production or function of the enzyme. The enzyme is activated by the pre-B cell receptor expressed in pre-B cells, and it delivers signals that promote the survival, proliferation, and maturation of these cells. The BTK gene is located on the X chromosome. Therefore, women who carry a mutant BTK allele on one of their X chromosomes are carriers of the disease, but male offspring who inherit the abnormal X chromosome are affected. In about a fourth of patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, autoimmune diseases, notably arthritis, develop as well. A link between an immunodeficiency and autoimmunity seems paradoxical. One possible explanation for this association is that BTK contributes to B cell receptor signaling and is required for central B cell tolerance, so defective BTK may result in the accumulation of autoreactive B cells.","targetRectangle":{"y":202.1055450439453,"x":24.21110153198242,"width":974.5283999999999,"height":353.7200000286102}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"texturedRectangle":{"isBackgroundTexture":false,"singleTextureOpacity":1,"textureType":0,"textBaseline":0,"textXHeight":0,"isVerticalText":false},"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"E357FD28B15222D5A6CA758D3C94E393"}]}]}}]}} )
